Peptide Drug Reference guide for healthcare professionals
Interactive Peptide Compendium
This project transforms the "Peptide Compendium: A Practical Reference for Prescribers" authored by Jobby John, PharmD, FACA, into a fully interactive, single-page web application. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with a dynamic and efficient tool to access and explore crucial information on various peptides.

This application was designed to move beyond a static document, offering a user-friendly interface for quick searching, filtering, and comparison of clinical data.

Features
Dynamic Search: Instantly find peptides by name.

Advanced Filtering: Easily filter the entire database by peptide class or clinical indication.

Interactive Data Visualization: Pharmacokinetic data, such as half-life and time to peak, is presented in clear, interactive charts for easy comparison.

Tabbed Navigation: Detailed information for each peptide is organized into clean, accessible tabs (Mechanism, Dosing, Clinical Pearls, Safety & Monitoring) to simplify information consumption.

Responsive Design: Fully functional and accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

How to Use
The application is split into two main panels for ease of use:

Left Sidebar: Contains the primary navigation. Use the search bar and dropdown menus to filter the list of peptides. Click on a peptide name to load its details.

Main Content Area: Displays the detailed information for the selected peptide. Use the tabs to navigate between different sections of the monograph.

Technology Stack
HTML5

Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.

JavaScript (ES6) for all interactivity, filtering, and DOM manipulation.

Chart.js for rendering dynamic and responsive charts.
